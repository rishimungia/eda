Hierarchical Clustering

Algorithm:
1. START
2. Read the dataset and import all the required packages.
3. Normalize the dataset.
4. Find the Euclidean Distance before hierarchical clustering.
5. Make the hierarchical clustering by using function hclust and mention the number of
clusters to be formed as k.
6. Plot the hierarchical clusters.
7. Mention which cluster the data belongs to using cuttree.
8. STOP
