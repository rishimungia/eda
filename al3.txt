Regression and Forecasting on Weather Data

Algorithm for multi-regression:
1. START
2. Read the dataset and import all the required packages.
3. Split the data into training data by either taking fraction or fixed sample rows.
4. Check which variables/features have strong corelation with each other.
a. If the value of correlation is close to 0 it means weak correlation.
b. If the absolute value is close to 1 then strong correlation.
5. Train the model with the variables/features which has strong correlation.
6. Based on the summary of the model decide whether the model is accepted or rejected
a. Observe the Pr(|t|) value,
i. If it is <0.05 then it is significant.
ii. Otherwise not significant
b. Observe the F-statistic value and p-value.
i. If p-value is <0.05 our model is accepted.
ii. Otherwise, the model is rejected.
7. Predict the required values with the help of the trained model
8. STOP

Algorithm for Forecast:
1. START
2. Read the dataset and import all the required packages.
3. Convert the dataset into a time series.
4. Check whether the data is stationary or not.
a. By plot using acf.
b. By using adf.test
i. If the value is <0.05 then it is stationary
ii. Otherwise, the data is not stationary.
5. Select the best model by using auto.arima
a. The model with the lowest value is the best.
6. Forecast the data by using the forecast function and mention the confidence level.
7. Plot the prediction done by the model
8. Print the accuracy of the model.
