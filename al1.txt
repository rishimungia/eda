Regression

Algorithm:
1. START
2. Read / Take the dependent say ‘y’ and independent say ‘x’ data as input.
3. Find the correlation between x and y.
a. If the correlation is close to -1 then it is strong negative correlation.
b. If the correlation is close to 0 then it shows weak correlation.
c. If the correlation is close to 1 then it shows strong positive correlation.
4. Split the dataset to get train data.
5. Draw the Scatter Plot between x and y.
6. Train the linear regression model between x and y.
7. Plot the regression line obtained by the trained model.
8. Summarize the model trained.
9. Based on summary decide where the model is accepted or rejected.
a. Observe the Pr(>|t|) value,
i. if it is <0.05 then it is significant
ii. otherwise not significant.
b. Observe the F-statistic value and p-value.
i. If p-value is <0.05 our model is accepted
ii. Otherwise, the model is rejected.
10. Predict the required values with the help of the trained model.
11. STOP
