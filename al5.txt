Logistic Regression

Algorithm:
1. START
2. Read the dataset and import all the required packages.
3. Split the dataset into the training and testing data.
4. Train the logistic regression model using glm function.
5. Summarize the model: check which variables are significant
6. Predict the result using the test data and build a confusion matrix.
7. With the confusion matrix find the accuracy of the model.
8. STOP
