Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)

Algorithm:
1. START
2. Read the dataset and import all the required packages.
3. Train the ANOVA model by using aov function and summarise.
4. Observe the value of Probability
a. If the value is >0.05 the null hypothesis is accepted and the values are not
significantly different from each other, the F-value is less than the critical
value.
b. Else the null hypothesis is rejected, and F-value is greater than the critical
value now test which values are significantly different by doing Tukey HSD
test
i. If the value of p adj is >0.05 then those two groups do not have
significant difference
ii. If the value of p adj is <0.05 then those two groups have significant
difference between them.
5. STOP
