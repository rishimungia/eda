K-NN Algorithm

Algorithm:
1. START
2. Read the dataset and import all the required packages (caTools and class).
3. Split the dataset into train and test dataset.
4. Normalize the test and train dataset while also removing the target and non-numerical
columns.
5. Train the knn model with knn(normtrain, normtest, train[,targetColumn], k).
6. Working of KNN model:
a. Select the number K of the neighbours.
b. Calculate the Euclidean distance of K number of neighbours.
c. Take the K nearest neighbour as per the calculated Euclidean distance.
d. Among the k neighbours, count the number of the data points in each
category.
e. Assign the new data points to the category for which the number of the
neighbour is maximum.
7. Plot the confusion matrix.
8. Calculate the accuracy of the model.
9. STOP
