Partitioning Based Clustering

Algorithm:
1. START
2. Read the dataset and import all the required packages (factoextra, cluster).
3. Find the value of K(number of clusters) using the elbow method.
4. Using the value of K train a model using kmeans clustering algorithm.
5. Classify the datapoints based on the model and divide them into there respective
clusters.
6. Plot the points with their respective clusters.
7. STOP
