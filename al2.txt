b. By using adf.test
i. If the value is <0.05 then it is stationary
ii. Otherwise, the data is not stationary.
5. Select the best model by using auto.arima
a. The model with the lowest value is the best.
6. Forecast the data by using the forecast function and mention the confidence level.
7. Plot the prediction done by the model
8. Print the accuracy of the model.
9. STOP
